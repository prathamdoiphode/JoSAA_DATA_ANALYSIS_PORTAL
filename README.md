# JoSAA DATA ANALYSIS PORTAL 


<section>
        <p>This project aims to create a portal to explore the seat allotment statistics of the Joint Seat 
Allocation Authority (JoSAA) until 2023. The portal allows users to analyse the data and provides 
insights and visualisations based on the JoSAA seat allotment data from 2016 to 2023. Below are 
the key objectives and technologies used in this project.</p>

         <h2>Usage</h2>
         <li><strong>To run the JoSAA Data Analysis Portal directly, click <a href="https://josaa-data-analysis-portal-1.onrender.com/">here</a>.</strong></li>
         <strong>Note</strong>:
         <ol>
         <li> It is advised to open the website on PC/Laptop. Still, if you are using it on mobile, please turn on the desktop mode for desired visualization.</li>
         <li>
          Due to the website we hosted our program on, there is a 1-2 second lag in 
the dropdown menus of each section. Please be patient as we work to fix this 
issue.</li></ol><br>

         <h2>Data Extraction and Cleaning</h2>
        The JoSAA seat allotment data has been provided and is ready for analysis. The data cleaning 
process involves using the NumPy and Pandas libraries to clean and transform the data as 
required for analysis. -->
